I am an artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Tehran, and recently, I have received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from there. My main research interests are generative models, deep learning, computer vision, and audio signal processing. In detail, I work on modeling dependencies in high fidelity images and audio using deep generative models. While I mainly focus on these areas, I am also interested in other domains such as natural language processing, computer graphics, and any other artificial-intelligence-related task.
