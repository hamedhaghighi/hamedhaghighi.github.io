I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick, UK, focusing on the application of deep generative models in autonomous driving, specifically in the synthesis of camera images and Lidar point clouds. Concurrently, I work as a machine learning researcher in the european union-funded project, Hi-Drive, where I am involved in the development of a semi-automated annotation tool called ML-ADA.

# Projects

## [Machine Learning-Assisted Data Annotation (ML-ADA) for 3D/2D Object Detection](https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/ML-assisted-annotation)
* Developing a semi-automatic data annotation tool (ML-ADA) that uses machine learning models to pre-annotate data. Simultaneously, it actively fine-tunes the models with the refined annotations the user provides.

## [Contrastive Learning-based Framework for Sim-to-Real Mapping of Lidar Point Clouds in Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15817)
* Research on utilising an unpaired image-to-image translation framework for sim-to-real mapping of Lidar point clouds.

## [Accelerating Stereo Image Simulation for Automotive Applications Using Neural Stereo Super Resolution](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173712)
* Proposing a tranformer-based stereo super resolution network to speed up stereo image rendering for automotive simulation environemnts.

## [Ambient VAE: an Unsupervised Method for Image Restoration](https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/Ambient-VAE)
* Research on using varational auto-encoders for the unsupervised image restoration task.

## [SampleTransformer: Modelling High Fidelity Music in Raw Audio Domain](https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/SampleTransformer)
* Research on capturing long range dependencies of music in audio domain through U-Net-based transformer architecture.

## [ITALIC: ITerative and Attentive Lossless Image Compression](https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/UTLC)
* Research on designing fast recursive model for lossless image compression task using attention mechanism.

## [Automatic evaluation of Crown Preparation using Image Processing Technique](https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/CPA-using-Image-processing-techniques)
* Design and implementation of innovative software for evaluating crown(tooth) preparation.
