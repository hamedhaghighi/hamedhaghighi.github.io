I am a PhD student at the University of Warwick, UK, focusing on the application of deep generative models in autonomous driving, specifically in the synthesis of camera images and Lidar point clouds. Concurrently, I work as a machine learning researcher in the European Union-funded project, Hi-Drive, where I am involved in the development of a semi-automated annotation tool called ML-ADA.
