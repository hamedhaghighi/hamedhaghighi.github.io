excerpt: '* Implementation of particle filter algorithm for realworld problem of E-puck robot localization.'
---
The project has two phases. In the first phase, we capture sensorsâ€™ models of our epuck robot to measure the distance from walls. In the second phase. we implement particle filter algorithm for robot localization in the simulation world. we first test our algorithm in the Webots simulator and then apply it for the real-world task. In Fig.1, an early and a late step of the particles and robot location has been demonstrated.
