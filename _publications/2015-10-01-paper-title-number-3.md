The project has two phases. In the first phase, we capture sensors' models of our epuck robot to measure distance from walls. In the second phase. we implement partile filter algorithm for robot localization in the simulation world. we first test our algorithm in the Webots simulator and then apply it for real world task. In the Fig.1, an early and a late step of the particles and robot location has been displayed .
